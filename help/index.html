<b>Hypercube VST</b> is a parameter reducer plugin for VST2 instruments and effects. It reduces 
the number of synthesizer/effect parameters to just three which makes it easier to find new sounds than changing 
100+ parameters that may be available through the normal user interface.

<p>
In order to to do parameter reduction a VST module must have roughly more presets of good instruments/effects than there are 
synthesizer parameters. The existing good presets are used to find "three dimensional space of good sounds", which can be then explored by using only 
three parameters: <b>X</b>, <b>Y</b> and <b>Z</b>. This means that parameter reduction doesn't work for some VST instruments 
because they don't allow reading and setting synthesizer parameters using VST2 specification functions. Additionally, Hypercube VST currently doesn't 
support newer VST3 instruments and only supports 64bit VST2 files.

<h3>Calculating parameter reduction</h3>
<p>
<img src="hypercube-vst-parameters.jpg" align="right">
To calculate parameter reduction you start Hypercube VST program. The user interface requires Java 64bit installation so please make sure 
to install 64bit Java (and not Java 32bit) before attempting to start Hypercube VST program. After starting the program select your 
VST directory from the menu by selecting "<b>File -> Select VST folder..</b>" after this click button "<b>Scan VST</b>" which goes through VST DLL files 
and reports if it is possible to create parameter reducted VST instrument for that file.

<p>
You can then make sure that "<b>Model complexity</b>" is set to default 1 and click "<b>Calculate VST</b>" button to calculate parameter reduction 
and create "<b>hypercube-&lt;vstfile&gt;.dll</b>" VST files to the VST folder. The 
generated Hypercube DLL files can be loaded by DAW host programs like Cubase as proper VST instruments which have only three synthesizer parameters (See the picture).
Because calculations can take hours, you might also want to calculate and create parameter reducer VST DLL for a single VST instrument.
This can be done by selecting a single file using "<b>File -> Select one VST file..</b>" and by then clicking the "<b>Calculate VST</b>" button.

<p>
To remove generated VST wrapper files either select a single VST plugin file or your VST plugin directory
and click "<b>Remove VST</b>" button to uninstall files generated by this software. Alternatively you
can manually remove all files having a word "hypercube" from your VST directory.

<h3>KNOWN BUGS</h3>
<p>
Code is still not very optimized so parameter automation may not always work in realtime in your VST host/DAW. 
I'm working to add NVIDIA CUDA support to the plugin which will hopefully give better realtime performance.
<p>
Hypercube VST modifies PATH environment variable to point to "C:\Program Files\Novel Insight Hypercube VST" which contains DLL files 
used by hypercube wrapper plugins. However, if there are earlier reference in PATH to same DLLs, earlier version DLLs 
(especially libstdc++-6.dll file) are used which don't always work and plugins cannot be loaded. 
The fix is to remove earlier reference to same DLLs in PATH (This can happen, for example, if you have installed a compiler that distributes
same DLL files or have multiple installations of this software).
<p>
Bad results. You can try to increase complexity or simple try to recalculate parameter reduction again to get slightly 
different results.
<p>
The unicode support for filenames may break sometimes as it is not fully tested. The fix is to rename all paths and filenames to have only ASCII
characters (mostly A-Z, 0-9).

Hypercube software can be used and distributed freely but it is closed source software and reverse engineering is prohibited.
The self-developed C++ software uses a non-linear deep learning model to calculate parameter reduction. The machine learning
model still have some limitations but I have found interesting sounds using this software in my own music projects. New versions
of this software will be released at the website <a href="http://www.novelinsight.fi/">http://www.novelinsight.fi/</a>.
<p>
If you use this software please help me (<a href="mailto:tomas.ukkonen@iki.fi">tomas.ukkonen@iki.fi</a>) to get a job as 
a Scientist or Data Scientist again (I live in Finland). 
<p>
I would also love to get your feedback as I've plans to develop software further.
